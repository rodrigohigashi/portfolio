Visitor Flow in Shopping Malls
📋 Overview
This project explores visitor behavior in shopping malls using machine learning clustering. By analyzing foot traffic patterns, the project aims to provide actionable insights to optimize mall layouts and improve the visitor experience.

🚀 Key Features
Data Exploration: Analysis of visitor counts in different mall areas.
K-Means Clustering: Used to identify and group areas with similar visitor traffic patterns.
Visualization: Insights are presented using charts and heatmaps for easy interpretation.
🔧 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for clustering (K-Means)
📂 Project Files
visitor_flow_malls.py: Main script containing the implementation.
mall_data.csv: Dataset used in the analysis.
